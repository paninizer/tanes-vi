###### Main article: [[Politics]]

The politics of Tanes-VI revolves around [[Tanium]] and as such, the dominating elites of all nations are comprised of only [[Mage|mages]]. Depending on the ruling structure of a nation ([[Democracy|democracy]], [[Constitutional Monarchy|constitutional monarchy]], etc.), non-magical people can have influence in state politics.

Various [[Wars|conflicts]] have been fought over the procurement of the increasingly rare Tanium. The nation with the most control over this metal is usually establishes a hegemony. Over the [[History|history of Tanes-VI]], many [[Wars|wars]] have been fought over the control of this precious resource. 

Furthermore, the advancements of [[Science|science]] in warfare leads to the creation of [[Homunculus|Homunculi]] in human-dominated, which are clones engineered with enriched Tanium to replace soldiers as to maintain public morale. Unfortunately, the Homunculi are considered expendable servants and were marginalised in society since they were quickly killed once their artificially accelerated ageing cripples them. Therefore, activists often try to sabotage Homunculi factories and fight for extended Homunculi rights, even though ideas like these were considered heretical.
