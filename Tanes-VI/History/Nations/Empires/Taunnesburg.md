Taunnesburg was an empire on the continent of [[Centia]] founded by [[Alfred Mansfield]]. Due to the [[Mythology#Vespises Conflict|Vespises Conflict]], [[Necromancer|Necromancers]] invaded the continent of [[Mavria]], displacing and enslaving the local population. The defeat of Necromancers took an entire [[Era]], and millions perished in the [[Battle of Mephisto]] to defeat the Necromancer [[Necron]] and drive the Necromancers to the wasteland of [[Necrom]].

Mansfield envisioned an empire based on equality between the non-magic and [[Mage|magic people]]. Though, his dreams proved short-lived as his heir, [[Fesir Mansfield|Fesir the Unequal]] consolidated mages' power in the society, effectively making them aristocrats with immense power. Over a millennia, the mages were made into the ruling aristocrats, with the empire expanding to control the entire continent.

Ultimately, the empire falls into a state of anarchy as powerful mage families struggle to produce heirs since inbreeding results in many hereditary illnesses that claimed the lives of many young aristocrats. Insurgencies followed as the non-magic people realized the weakness of the ruling class and established the [[First Republic of Nemo]].
