The history of [[Tanes-VI]] is fractured and filled with bloodshed, revolving around the domination of the world and the precious metal [[Tanium]]. Beginning with [[Unified Era]], history is more well documented than in previous [[Era|Eras]], where [[Mythology]] is more frequently mixed with proper history, making it difficult for historians and archivists to verify the origins of civilization. 

The history of Tanes-VI is divided into Eras, with distinct characteristics that began and ended with major events. The first documented Era is the [[Langia Cerembor]], or "Celestial's Domain." [[Precursors]] dominated this era, and ultimately perished from a series of [[Disasters|disasters]]. The second Era is the [[Langia Novegia]], which documents the rise of the first [[Elf|people]] recovering from the disasters that wiped out the Precursors. The [[Vespises Trilogy]] is the Era where magic and [[Mage|mages]] rise to control the society, ending with the [[Battle of Mephisto]] and the [[Great Dimming]].
